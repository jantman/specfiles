specfiles
=========

A collection of my RPM spec files for RHEL/CentOS and Fedora. These are largely spec files from other repositories or upstream locations, modified to build on CentOS 5 and 6, or other distributions. Be aware that some of these are pulled in from my other repositories using git submodules.
